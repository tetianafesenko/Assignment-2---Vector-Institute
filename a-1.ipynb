    "(a) Utilize ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com/auth/login) to provide you with example python code of a decision tree classifier for one of the classification sklearn.datasets (e.g., iris/breast cancer, wine) with training, validation, and test splits. This implementation will produce an X_train, X_val, X_test, y_train, y_val and y_test."
